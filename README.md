# **Fine-Tuned GPT-Neo 2.7B for Question Answering**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is focused on **fine-tuning GPT-Neo 2.7B** for **question-answering tasks** using the **SQuAD v2 dataset**. The goal was to optimize the model for **faster training, lower memory usage, and improved performance** using **DeepSpeed, LoRA, and mixed precision (bf16) training**.  

The fine-tuned model can be used in various NLP applications, including:  
- **Conversational AI**  
- **Automated Q&A Systems**   
- **Information Retrieval** 

Since working with large-scale LLMs can be resource-intensive, this project focuses on **efficient fine-tuning techniques** to get the best results without requiring high-end hardware.

## **What You Need to Reproduce This Project**  

### **🔹 System Requirements**  
- A **GPU-enabled setup** (Google Colab, AWS, or a local machine with CUDA).  
- At least **16GB VRAM recommended** for fine-tuning.  

### **🔹 Libraries & Frameworks**  
To fine-tune or run the model, you’ll need:  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – for working with GPT-Neo.  
- **DeepSpeed** – to speed up training and reduce memory usage.  
- **PyTorch** – for training and inference.  
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** – for more efficient fine-tuning.  
- **Accelerate** – for optimized multi-GPU training.  
- **Weights & Biases (Optional)** – for experiment tracking.  

### **🔹 Dataset Used**  
- **SQuAD v2** – a benchmark dataset for Question Answering.  
- Since training on the full dataset is resource-intensive, **only 2%** was used for ultra-fast fine-tuning.  

### **🔹 Model Weights & Storage**  
- The full **fine-tuned model weights** are **too large for GitHub**, so they are stored externally.  
- **Download `pytorch_model.bin` from:**

## ** How the Model Was Trained**  

### **1️. Preprocessing the Dataset**  
- The **SQuAD v2 dataset** was tokenized with a **max sequence length of 128** for faster training.  
- **Padding & truncation** were applied to ensure consistent input sizes.  

### **2️. Fine-Tuning Process**  
- Used **DeepSpeed Zero-Offload (Stage 2)** to handle large model sizes efficiently.  
- **LoRA adapters** were applied to reduce the number of trainable parameters.  
- **bf16 Mixed Precision** was enabled to speed up training and reduce memory usage.  

### **3️. Model Evaluation**  
- The fine-tuned model was tested on **2% of the SQuAD v2 validation set**.  
- Performance was measured using **accuracy, loss, and perplexity scores**.
